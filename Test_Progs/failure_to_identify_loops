# Failure to Identify select Loops
#
# When a properly formed select loop appears in certain contexts,
# such as before a line containing certain patterns of dollar signs
# or quotes,
# it will not be properly identified and translated into standard Perl.
#
# The following is such an example:
#
#    use Shell::POSIX::Select;
#    select (@names) { print ; }
#    # $X$
#
# The failure of the filtering routine to rewrite the loop causes the
# compiler to issue the following fatal error when it sees the
# { following the (LIST):
#	
# syntax error at filename line X, near ") {"
#
# This of course prevents the program from running.
#
# The problem is either a bug in Filter::Simple, or one of the modules on
# which it depends.
# Until this is resolved, you may be able to 
# handle such cases by explicitly turning filtering off before the offending
# code is encountered, using the no directive:
#
#    use Shell::POSIX::Select;     # filtering ON
#    select (@names) { print ; }
#
#    no Shell::POSIX::Select;      # filtering OFF
#    # $X$

# Is this resolved?
