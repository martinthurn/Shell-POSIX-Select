This directory contains the sample programs shown in the 
documentation for the Shell::POSIX::Select module.

The module's installation routine does not install them in
any system command directory, but you should be able to find
them where the module was installed. And I guess you did,
if you're reading this!

Note that some of these programs won't do anything at all
if they're invoked without arguments, so please examine
the documentation or the scripts themselves to learn how
to run them.

These programs are provided for their educational value,
and I believe they work correctly, but they do not come
with a warranty of any kind. 

I hope you find them useful!  

I am the copyright holder, so for any questions about fair
use, please contact me.
